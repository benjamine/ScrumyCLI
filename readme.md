Scrumy CLI
==============

**Command line interface for simple batch tasks on http://scrumy.com boards.**

Scrumy.com is a website that offers online scrum boards (sprint backlogs).
I'm not related to scrumy.com, I wrote this tool simplify some batch tasks we do on CI:
 - Add a "Test" task to each story
 - After a successfull build to QA, nark "Test" tasks in the verify column as "QA" (using scrumer name)

ScrumyCLI could be used for:

 - Querying the current sprint (filtering by story title, task title, state or scrumer)
 - Perform some batch changes on the filtered results:
   - Add a task to each story
   - Set task scrumer
   - Set task state
   - Add text to task title
   - Remove task

Note: ScrumyCLI uses scrumy.com REST API, which at the moment of this writing, doesn't support realtime notifications, so after doing modifications to your current sprint with this tool, you have to Refresh to see them on your browser.

## Requirements

 - NodeJS 0.6+ (with npm)
 - In order to access the scrumy.com REST API you need to register a PRO Project board on http://scrumy.com

Note: scrumy password can be specified as a command argument, otherwise it will be prompted on the command line.
