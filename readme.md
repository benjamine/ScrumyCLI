Scrumy CLI
==============

**Command line interface for simple batch tasks on http://scrumy.com boards.**

Scrumy.com is a website that offers online scrum boards (sprint backlogs).

ScrumyCLI could be used for:

 - Querying the current sprint (filtering by story title, task title, state or scrumer)
 - Perform some batch changes on the filtered results:
   - Add a task to each story
   - Set task scrumer
   - Set task state
   - Add text to task title
   - Remove task

Note: ScrumyCLI uses scrumy.com REST API, which at the moment of this writing, doesn't support realtime notifications, so after doing modifications to your current sprint with this tool, you have to Refresh to see them on your browser.

I'm not related to scrumy.com, I wrote this tool to simplify some batch tasks we do (at http://www.tercerplaneta.com) on CI:

 - Add a "Test" task to each story

``` bash
    # add a "Test" task to each story that doesn't have it already
    node scrumycli.js -b myboard -t Test -E --addtask Test
```

 - After a successfull build to QA, mark "Test" tasks in the verify column as "QA" (using scrumer name)

``` bash
    # mark all tasks with title "Test" in the "verify" column as ready in QA (scrumer name "QA")
    node scrumycli.js -b myboard -t Test -s verify --setscrumer QA
```

## Requirements

 - NodeJS 0.6+ (with npm)
 - In order to access the scrumy.com REST API you need to register a PRO Project board on http://scrumy.com
